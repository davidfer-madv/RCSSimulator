## 🚧 **ISSUES TO FIX (From Your Testing)**

### ❌ Issue #1: Device UI Doesn't Match Real Android/iOS Experience
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High

**Problems:**
- Current UI is simplified
- Needs to match Google Messages app on Android exactly
- Needs to match iOS Messages/Business Chat exactly

**Figma References:**
- Android Rich Card: `node-id=1559-4365`
- Android Device UI (Google Messages): `node-id=132-73`  
- iOS Rich Card: `node-id=1323-12643`

**Action Needed:**
- Study Figma designs in detail
- Update AndroidStatusBar, AndroidHeader to match Google Messages
- Update iOS components to match Apple Messages
- Match exact colors, fonts, spacing, shadows

### ❌ Issue #2: PNG Image Not Rendering After Save
**Status:** Critical Bug
**Priority:** URGENT

**Root Cause:**
From your logs:
```
processedImageUrls: [ 'blob:http://localhost:3000/12de2a9a...' ]  ← Blob URL (temporary)
imageUrls: [ '/uploads/1760746739692-6dd92e0de73ec4c1.png' ]      ← Uploaded URL (permanent)
```

**Problem:**
- Preview uses `state.processedImageUrls` (blob URLs)
- After save, blob URLs expire but preview doesn't update to server URLs
- Image shows as broken after page refresh

**Fix Required:**
1. After successful save, update context state with server imageUrls
2. Or: Refresh the format from server after save
3. Or: Convert imageUrls to full URLs for preview

**File to Fix:**
`client/src/pages/rcs-formatter-new.tsx` lines 211-227 (onSuccess callback)

### ✅ Issue #3: Redundant "New Format" Dropdown
**Status:** FIXED ✅
**Commit:** 9d65417

The menu now only appears on Dashboard, Campaigns, Customers, Settings pages.
Hidden when you're already on the RCS Formatter page.

## 🎬 **Video Request**

You mentioned: "Let me know if you want to see a video on how both render"

**YES! That would be extremely helpful!**

Please share videos showing:

This will help me match the exact real-world behavior!
